# prisma-generator-garph
Generate versatile typebox schemes from your prisma schema.

> This is still under development, expect bugs and breaks!

> Currently does not support mongoDB composite types (https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models#defining-composite-types)

Install it in your project,
```bash
npm i -D prismabox
pnpm i -D prismabox
bun i -D prismabox
```

 then add
```prisma
generator prismabox {
  provider = "prismabox"
  // you can optionally specify the output location. Defaults to ./prismabox
  output = "./myCoolPrismaboxDirectory"
  // if you want, you can customize the imported variable name that is used for the schemes. Defaults to "Type" which is what the standard typebox package offers
  typeboxImportVariableName = "t"
  // you also can specify the dependency from which the above import should happen. This is useful if a package re-exports the typebox package and you would like to use that
  typeboxImportDependencyName = "elysia"
  // by default the generated schemes do not allow additional properties. You can allow them by setting this to true
  additionalProperties = true
  // optionally enable the data model generation. See the data model section below for more info
  dataModel = true
}
```
to your `prisma.schema`. You can modify the settings to your liking, please see the respective comments for info on what the option does.

## Annotations
Prismabox offers annotations to adjust the output of models and fields.

| Annotation | Example | Description |
---|---|---
| @prismabox.hide | - | Hides the field or model from the output |
| @prismabox.hidden | - | Alias for @prismabox.hide |
| @prismabox.hide.data | - | Hides the field or model from the output only in the data model |
| @prismabox.options | @prismabox.options{ min: 10, max: 20 } | Uses the provided options for the field or model in the generated schema. Be careful to use valid JS/TS syntax! |

A schema using annotations could look like this:
```prisma
/// The post model
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  /// @prismabox.hidden
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  title     String   @unique

  User   User? @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  /// @prismabox.options{max: 10}
  /// this is the user id
  userId Int?
}

/// @prismabox.hidden
enum Account {
  PASSKEY
  PASSWORD
}

```
> Please note that you cannot use multiple annotations in one line! Each needs to be in its own!
## Generated Schemes
The generator will output schema objects based on the models. It will output multiple variables for each model:
```ts
// the plain object without any relations
export const PostPlain = ...

// only the relations of a model
export const PostRelations = ...

// a composite model of the two, providing the full type
export const Post = ...

// a model enforcing a unique selector for a query to an entity
// this can be passed to e.g. a `findUnique()` query in prisma
export const PostWhere = ...

// a model for input data validation. Only contains non relation fields and filters out
// some typically auto generated fields like "id" or "createdAt"
// can be used for entity creation
// respects the @prismabox.hide.data annotation to ignore fields specifically for the data model
export const PostData = ...
// just like the above but allows each field to be not set. Useful for updating entities
export const PostDataOptional = ...


```

### Data models
To simplify the validation of input data, prismabox is able to generate schemes specifically for input data.
These are called "DataModels" and need to be explicitly enabled in the generator settings (`dataModel = true`) because they expect some conventions/field naming patterns to work properly. If you want to see the specifics on how the model works, see [the code](./src/generator/dataModel.ts).

1. Foreign Ids need to end in Id (case is ignored)
2. To be detected as foreign key id, a relation field with a matching name must exist (case is ignored):
```prisma
  User   User? @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  // will be detected
  userId Int?

  // we change the name to something other than post
  myCoolPost   Post? @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  // will NOT be detected
  postId Int?
```
3. createdAt will be detected and ignored if it follows exactly this pattern: `createdAt DateTime @default(now())`
